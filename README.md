# Apache Kafka Overview

Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform designed for high-throughput, real-time data processing. It enables applications to publish, store, and process streams of records in a fault-tolerant manner.

## Key Components

1. **Producer**  
   A **producer** is responsible for publishing (writing) messages to Kafka topics. It can send data asynchronously, ensuring efficient and fault-tolerant communication.

2. **Broker**  
   A **broker** is a Kafka server that stores and manages incoming messages. Kafka clusters typically have multiple brokers to ensure scalability and fault tolerance.

3. **Consumer**  
   A **consumer** subscribes to topics and processes messages. Consumers are part of consumer groups, which allow load balancing and parallel data processing across multiple instances.

## What is an Event Streaming Platform?

An **event streaming platform** is a system that continuously captures, processes, stores, and delivers streams of data (events) in real time. Events are individual records representing something that happened, like a user clicking a button, a sensor sending a reading, or a transaction being made.

## Key Characteristics of Kafka as an Event Streaming Platform:

* **Real-time Processing**: Events are produced and consumed as they occur.
* **Durability & Scalability**: Events are stored and can be replayed, ensuring fault tolerance.
* **Decoupled Architecture**: Producers and consumers are independent, allowing flexibility in how data flows between services.
* **High Throughput**: Handles massive amounts of data efficiently.

Kafka enables businesses to build real-time data pipelines and event-driven applications by processing streams of data as they are generated. [1]

## Commands
```bash
1. for Kakfa setup, download it using the following command:
wget https://downloads.apache.org/kafka/3.9.0/kafka_2.12-3.9.0.tgz

2. To install the setup
tar -xzf kafka_2.12-3.9.0.tgz

3. To install Java, use the following commands:
sudo yum install java
java -version

4. Change the directory to kafka installed directory using 
cd kafka_2.12-3.9.0

5. Start Zoo-keeper:
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

6.Open another window to start kafka
But first ssh to to your ec2 machine
Start Kafka-server:
Duplicate the session & enter in a new console --
export KAFKA_HEAP_OPTS="-Xmx256M -Xms128M"
cd kafka_2.12-3.9.0
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

7. It is pointing to private server , change server.properties so that it can run in public IP 
To do this , you can follow any of the 2 approaches shared below
Do a "sudo nano config/server.properties" - change ADVERTISED_LISTENERS to public ip of the EC2 instance

8. Create the topic, using following steps:
Duplicate the session & enter in a new console
cd kafka_2.12-3.9.0
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic demo_testing --bootstrap-server 'Put the Public IP of your EC2 Instance:9092' --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1

9. Start Producer, using following steps:
Duplicate the session & enter in a new console
cd kafka_2.12-3.9.0
bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic demo_testing --bootstrap-server 'Put the Public IP of your EC2 Instance:9092'

10. Start Consumer, using following steps:
Duplicate the session & enter in a new console:
cd kafka_2.12-3.9.0
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic demo_testing --bootstrap-server 'Put the Public IP of your EC2 Instance:9092'
